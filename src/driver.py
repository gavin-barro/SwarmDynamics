"""
    Driver module to be used to run our program.
    This python module runs the simulation and collections information on it.
    It will run the simulation for a select amount of ticks and every tick the 
    information on the program will outputed. The idea of this simulation is 
    to simulate the introduction of an invasive species and its impact on an exsisting
    ecosystem. 
    
    Invasive flower gives more pollen than the other flowers in the ecosystem
    The bees gravitate towards that flower
