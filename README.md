## About
As a part of our final project for ISAT 441, we decided to simulate the effect of invasive hives on local ecosystems

## Problem Statement
This project involved simulating a dynamic hive, flower, and bee ecosystem to explore how nectar availability influences 
the production and survival of both bees and flowers, while ensuring a sustainable balance between resource consumption 
and regeneration. To deepen our analysis, we developed two versions of this ecosystem: one featuring only native flower 
species and another incorporating an invasive flower species. By comparing the two models, we aimed to uncover the effects
of invasive species on resource competition among flowers, the sustainability of bee hives, and the overall health and 
resilience of the ecosystem. This approach allowed us to examine how changes in species composition can disrupt ecological
equilibrium and impact long-term sustainability.

## Problem Significance
The ease and frequency of global transportation have significantly increased the movement of species across geographic boundaries,
often leading to the unintended introduction of invasive species into new ecosystems. Additionally, human development of previously
untouched areas disrupts the balance of existing ecosystems, creating opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves. 
Invasive species such as Japanese Switchgrass, Burmese pythons, and Spotted Lanternflies exemplify this growing ecological challenge. 
These species outcompete native flora and fauna for resources, disrupt food webs, and compromise biodiversity, ultimately threatening 
the sustainability of the ecosystems they invade[1]. Understanding and mitigating the impacts of invasive species are critical to 
preserving ecological health and ensuring the resilience of both natural and human-altered environments.


## Conceptual Model

Our conceptual model draws inspiration from the Beecology Project[2], which addresses the alarming decline in wild pollinators, 
focusing on their abundance, diversity, and geographic distribution. This decline poses a critical threat to ecosystem health and 
biodiversity, with insufficient ecological data hampering effective conservation efforts. The Beecology Project engages citizen 
scientists to collect and submit data on native pollinators through innovative smartphone and web apps, complemented by online 
visualization tools designed for diverse users, including researchers, educators, and conservation groups. By analyzing bumblebee-plant
interactions and later expanding to nesting and overwintering behaviors, the project seeks to enhance pollinator habitats and identify 
the causes of their decline. Using this as a foundation, our model adapts key aspects of their approach, emphasizing ecosystem dynamics 
and species interactions, while tailoring the focus to study the impacts of invasive species on resource competition and ecological 
sustainability. This alignment allowed us to leverage proven methodologies while addressing a unique aspect of ecosystem health.

They chose to simulate a pollination ecosystem involving different types of bees, flowers, and an invasive flower species. Their model
included four different breeds: seeds, flowers, hives, and bees, each with specific properties to represent their behavior like nectar 
collection, pollination, and reproduction. Bees forage for nectar and pollen and flowers bloom and reproduce via seeds, and hives serve
as storage for collected nectar. The environment is also modeled with areas that contain seeds that directly influence where flowers grow.
Their simulation also includes adjustable parameters such as bee preferences, nectar regeneration rates, and flower lifespans to study how
these factors share the ecosystem.

Three scenarios are predefined in their model to explore different ecological outcomes. In the baseline scenario, invasive flowers fail to
dominate the ecosystem. In the second scenario, invasive flowers outcompete the native species due to high bee preferences and overlapping
bloom times. In the third scenario, bees of one species favor invasive flowers, leading to competitive displacement of the other bee species.
This model allows users to study pollination dynamics, the impact of invasive species, and how species-specific preferences influence 
biodiversity and ecosystem stability.
